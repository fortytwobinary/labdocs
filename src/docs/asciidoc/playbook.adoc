Welcome to the FortyTwoBinary Network and Infrastructure Playbook. This
document is subject to great change and will be maintained in a software
repository https://github.com/fortytwobinary/labdocs[here].

[WARNING]
This playbook was drafted and is maintained as a DevOps reference to the
work that occurs on the FortyTwoBinary network and infrastructure. The
powerful command-line instructions found here, may or may not be accurate
or timely. This warning is given to let the DevOp be aware that commands
may not be idempotent and before root-level (sudo) actions are taken, to
think twice before hitting the Enter key.

**********************************************************************
This is a large document, but it's probably good to keep all of the
material contained here in one place. A playbook is a powerful reference
that can be of great value in the event of data loss, machine crashes,
backups, maintenance, installations, and troubleshooting.
**********************************************************************


Introduction
------------
The network and infrastructure playbook is a compilation of the notes,
configurations, how-tos, general, and technical documentation that will
follow the evolution of the FortyTwoBinary network. This treatise will
outline and describe the network, the configurations, the machines,
and the software the operates over it.

The FortyTwoBinary network is an internal network behind a home ISP or
Internet Service Provider and protected from the public internet via
a secure and highly configured network router.

FortyTwoBinary is a made up organization name for our home network and
used in the event that other people join me in my learning and education.

.My Mission
**********************************************************************
Kubernetes has emerged as powerful way to serve web content and move
data over the internet at grand scale. This is very expensive even for
well-paid consultants to learn on their own. Small computers and virtual
machines are inexpensive and convenient to own. My mission is to learn
more about containers, hosting, and clustering all on my own time and
do this economically of course.

Turing Pi is now making a cluster board for multiple Raspberry Pi boards
and the cluster capability for up to 28 cores or 7 Raspberry Pi computers.
Canonical Ubuntu is also producing a software product called MicroK8s or
what they call a no-more, no-less version of Kubernetes that will run on
a single server host. The FortyTwoBinary network (my home network) is
slowly becoming a laboratory for learning.

Virtual
~~~~~~~
This section describes the virtual machines that participate in the fortytwobinary.lab
experiments. These virtual machines perform some service or function in
the overall schema of getting work done.

- None at this time

Network and Components
----------------------
There are various components public and private at play on the network that
support and manage data on the fortytwobinary.lab domain proper. These pieces will
be described within this section.

Internet Service Provider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Spectrum is our internet service provider (ISP). They provide entry to
the world-wide web (WWW) at a public IP address. This
IP is NOT static. It does however, remain the same for long periods of
time but it is not guaranteed to be fixed.

Our service enters our house via coaxial cable from the street and
enters a cable modem before sending ethernet into a Netgear router
with network address translation (NAT) from public IP to
192.168.1.1, All port-forwarding is handled via configuration within
the wireless access point (WAP) and router combination.

Router and WAP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Our router and wireless access point is a Netgear ... later

Network Attached Storage (NAS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A G-Technology 500GB external drive is attached to the Kubernetes tower on kube-master for
shared storage via network file storage or NFS.

Switches
~~~~~~~~
We currently maintain 2 Netgear unmanaged switches for ethernet propagation, one 5-port GS105
and an 8-port GS-308.

Private Network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The FortyTwoBinary.lab network is private. This local area network (LAN) begins with a 192.168.1 subnet with 192.168.1.1 being the gateway (through our router) to the public internet (WAN). We (FortyTwoBinary) own the domain fortytwobinary.com and are currently hosting static web sites at https://site.fortytwobinary.com and https://apache.fortytwobinary.com . A wiki is also hosted at https://wikijs.fortytwobinary.com .

A single DNS (Bind9) server hosts forwarding and reverse lookups for the trusted servers configured for use with the fortytwobinary.lab private network.

Domain Name System (DNS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The domain name system or DNS is managed using 2 Android TV computers (8-Core) that are part
of another SBC tower. Aptly named, ns1 and ns2.fortytwobinary.lab, these servers host and
maintain (redundant) a Bind9 DNS service to the network.

Secrets Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Secrets management for the FortyTwoBinary lab will be handled using Hashicorp Vault. This service is currently running on an unidentified (here) server. Backups are being performed (see below) daily with a Jenkins job. Failure in the system would require the restoration of the vault server (binary) and population on the filesystem with a daily backup tar.

Reliability is good because the Vault server is running on a single network server as the only hosted service. The server is dedicated. The unseal keys and root token do not reside on the machine.
