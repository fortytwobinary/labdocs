Welcome to the FortyTwoBinary service documentation for the Network File System (NFS) on multiple platforms. This document is subject to great change and will
be maintained in a software repository https://github.com/fortytwobinary/labdocs[here].

[WARNING]
This {description} was drafted and is maintained as a DevOps reference to the work that occurs on the FortyTwoBinary network and infrastructure. The
powerful command-line instructions found here, may or may not be accurate
or timely. This warning is given to let the DevOp be aware that commands
may not be idempotent and before root-level (sudo) actions are taken, to
please think twice before hitting the Enter key.

Introduction
------------
Network File System (NFS) is a distributed file system protocol originally developed by Sun Microsystems (Sun) in 1984 <<sandberg-goldberg-kleiman-walsh-lyon>> NFS allows the actual file system to reside on a single machine and then share the file system path across multiple machines.

The master node of the Pi tower "Frankie" hosts a 500 GB USB external G-Technology drive at `/mnt/ext`. This
filesystem is then exported to the other nodes as NFS clients.

.My Goal for NFS
**********************************************************************
Since each of the Kubernetes nodes form a cluster of similar computers,
each node needs a similar filesystem storage path (shared). The NFS mount
will be used for Persistent Volumes and Claims for K8s hostings. Any
machine will be able to send data to the Persistent Volume and subsequently
the filesystem path (shared) regardless of the worker sending the data.
**********************************************************************

Preliminaries
-------------

Goal
~~~~
The goal here is to install and maintain an NFS mount (server) on our Kubernetes
cluster master node and share that mount (clients) on all worker nodes.

Platforms
~~~~~~~~~
NFS server and client software will be installed on arm64 Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Server with arm64 Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and physical volume
- Client hosts with arm64 Ubuntu 20.04

NFS Server Installation
-----------------------
The server installation is done with the apt utility as sudo. On the master node and the node with the physical mount, install the NFS server package(s).
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y nfs-kernel-server
----
NFS uses a file in `/etc` called `exports` to let everyone know about the new physical mount. Add this to the file `/etc/exports`
[source,bash]
----
/mnt/ext *(rw,no_root_squash,insecure,async,no_subtree_check,anonuid=1000,anongid=1000)
----
Now, let all of our system NFS clients know about the new mount.

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo exportfs -ra
----
We're done here. Now let's move on to the NFS clients.

NFS Client Installation
-----------------------

TIP: Remember that the client installation here needs to be done on all nodes. I'm only describing the process once.

The client installation is also done with the apt utility as sudo. Let's install the client package(s).
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y nfs-common
----
Now, create a file system mount with the same path as kube-master (master node).
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/ext
$ sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /mnt/ext/
----
Ask ourselves, "what do we know at this point?" We have installed the NFS client software. We created a
mapped file system path back to the master node's physical mount. And, we've set ownership for the file system
so that our user `ubuntu` can use it when it's working.

Now, we're going to add the actual NFS mount to our file system tabulation in `/etc/fstab`. Open `/etc/fstab`
and add the following.
[source]
----
192.168.1.12:/mnt/ext /mnt/ext nfs rw 0 0
----
Reboot the NFS client host, open a terminal and navigate to the mount. You should see this.
[source]
----
ubuntu@kube-worker-1:/mnt/ext$ ls
lost+found
----
If you don't see `lost+found` then the system did not mount the new NFS filesystem. If you do see it, we're done.

[WARNING]
Do not just assume that a system reboot will mount `/mnt/ext` by the system just "knowing" to somehow call
`mount /mnt/ext`. Two of my workers would not mount on reboot and I fixed this with adding a new service to
systemd. I'll not discuss that here but did want to mention this.
