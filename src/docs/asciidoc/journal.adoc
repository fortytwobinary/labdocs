Welcome to the FortyTwoBinary service journal of infrastructure changes
on multiple platforms across our home network. This document is subject
to great change and will be maintained in a software repository
https://github.com/fortytwobinary/labdocs[here].

== Introduction
This document contains my writings on the build-out of a network fortytwobinary.lab
and the infrastructure to support a Kubernetes environment using 3 Raspberry
Pi small board computers (SBC) to start.

The network will host a Gitlab instance as a central repository for source, configuration,
documentation, and reference.

The fortytwobinary.lab network is strictly for experimentation and education.

== Mar 2021
I'll start my journal here with a picture of the devices currently on the
FortyTwoBinary home (internal) network. Here's a snip from the router admin
showing the wired and wireless devices currently enabled. I'll dive into more
detail below.

The two wired machines prefixed with `kube-` are the two machines at the bottom
of my Raspberry Pi tower. These two machines are Pi 3 Model Bs. They are currently
running Raspbian-lite (buster 10) on 16GB micro SD cards. The machines above them
are newer Pi 4 Model B devices.

Yes, it's a mess but, it's a start. Currently, the middle, 192.168.1.7
or third from the bottom is the first 4B I've purchased. It's currently hosting
Gitlab on port 80 and these pages on 8081. This journal page is hosted by an
Apache2 docker image on that middle machine. The machine is currently named
angry-apache and is connected to the network via wireless adapter.

The very top machine, 192.168.1.16 hosts a Bind9 service for the fortytwobinary.int or
FortyTwoBinary internal (home) network. It is also a Raspberry Pi 4B and connected
to the network via wireless. His name is uptight-genius because he's the anal
name guy.

The second from the top machine 192.168.1.15 or oily-weasel is currently just
running. As part of this Kubernetes on Pi initiative, he's just a new Pi 4B
volunteer that's offered his assistance as a kube-worker.

=== Mar 13, 2021

Last night I put the tower together, but the newer computers were already hosting
Bind9, Apache, Vault, and Gitlab. I flashed two new micro SD cards with Raspbian
Lite for the two older machines on the bottom of my new tower. These older machines
were named today (see playbook) but hostnames and DNS have not been set up due to
Kubernetes changes coming.

=== Mar 14, 2021
Here are the decisions I've made today. I have two groups of SBCs, 5 raspberry pi
computers (tower) and 3 KM8Ps (octa-core arm64). I currently host Gitlab and Apache
on one of the Pi machines. And another Pi Model 4B is idle. These two will NOT host
Kubernetes. The third Pi Model 4B will be the Kubernetes master and the two Pi Model
3B machines will be Kubernetes workers.

DNS, currently on one of the Pi machines will be moved to one of the KM8P devices
and a secondary nameserver will be created on another KM8P. I suspect the third KM8P
will handle all cron activity and maybe even host NFS storage (for backups). The
Kubernetes initiative will support a shared NFS as well but I think that a 128GB
micro SD would be a prime choice for an NFS mount to store backups.

Last night, I flashed three new micro SD cards with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS for aarm64,
updated, upgraded, installed docker, configured kernel parameters for cgroups,
configured iptables for bridged networking, and then installed Kubernetes on all 3.
That was quite an accomplishment. I also initialize kube-master and show a Ready status.

I ran across some things that require some further education. These are listed below:

- before initialization I should have found the kubeadm version before making the initialization
command. (TODO)
- I picked or just copied a CIDR choice and I have no clue how this is used or why it was chosen. (TODO)
- After initialization, it seemed as though kube-master was running as a control-plane node however, `kubectl get nodes` showed status as Not Ready. I fixed this by creating a kube-flannel.yaml manifest but I never thought that just copying off the Github site would have worked. It did! And, now `kubectl get nodes' shows status Ready.

Last night, I added a NAS or Network Attached Storage to the tower which I've aptly named Frankie, short for Frankenstein. I also created flashed two more 16GB micro-SD cards with Ubuntu 20.04 and re-imaged tower-1 and tower-2. Tower-1 was the apache web server and my Gitlab instance. I moved the repos to public Github. I don't really have anything to hide and I like having my code on Github and well-protected.

The NFS went well for kube-master and workers 1 and 2. Hosting and client operations all were successful however, new workers 3 and 4 won't auto-mount. Something is NOT calling the `/etc/fstab` file so the mount is not created at /mnt/ext.
