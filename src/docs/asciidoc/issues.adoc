== Introduction
This document contains my writings of technical issues that I am dealing with
at work (names changed to protect the innocent) and/or issues I am dealing with
at home on machines I own or my home network.

== May 2021
I'm currently very busy with MuleSoft work and with a knowledge management system
being proposed to my employer. I'm learning lots of new things and trying to
prepare for a CKAD or Certified Kubernetes Application Developer certification.

=== May 7, 2021
I need to create a custom Mule component for Mule 4 that verifies a JSON payload
specifically for both decimal currency values and rounded or integer currency values. The validator needs to parse the payload and test load java's BigDecimal
and BigInteger to assure that we can convert and maintain these values as Strings.

MuleSoft documentation provides a high-level project creation for the initial
generation of a working component. This document is found here: https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-sdk/1.1/getting-started

I had great difficulty making the operations show up in AnypointStudio with my
namespaces for operations. I also needed the payload in the component's operation
method and this posting or KB from MuleSoft seems to have an answer. I need to
test this myself but it may be what I really need. https://help.mulesoft.com/s/article/How-To-Pass-Payload-In-Mule-4-SDK

More to come ...
