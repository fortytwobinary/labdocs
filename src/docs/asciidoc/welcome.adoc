Welcome to David L. Whitehurst's Tavros lab documentation. These documents are subject
to great change and will be maintained in a software repository https://github.com/dlwhitehurst/labdocs[here].

== Introduction
I am a software professional and with the popularity of Kubernetes, I now write software
that runs on a Kubernetes platform. Most developers tinker with new technology at home, at
night. And, employers can't afford to train their staff or allow consultants to just learn
on the job. For my situation, Kubernetes is expensive to host in the cloud for personal
and training reasons. I've recently arrived at a better solution and that's my own K8s
cluster using recently available Model 4b Raspberry Pi machines.

My cluster consists of 3 model 4b and 2 model 3b Raspberry Pi small board computers (SBC).

== Environment
The FortyTwoBinary lab environment is simply a home network, 8 SBCs (arm64),
an 8-port switch, a 5-port switch, a wireless router, and a public ISP. I currently host a
few services publicly and all communications are protected with PKI certificates.

The following hyperlinks provide navigation to the lab documentation content. Links are given
here because the documents are not organized and it's more convenient to just list them here.
