Introduction
------------
I am a software professional and with the popularity of Kubernetes, I now write software
that runs on a Kubernetes platform. Most developers tinker with new technology at home, at
night. And, employers can't afford to train their staff or allow consultants to just learn
on the job. For my situation, Kubernetes is expensive to host in the cloud for personal
and training reasons. I've recently arrived at a better solution and that's my own K8s
cluster using recently available Model 4b Raspberry Pi machines.

My cluster consists of 3 model 4b and 2 model 3b Raspberry Pi SBCs.

Environment
-----------
The FortyTwoBinary lab environment is simply a home network, 8 small board computers (arm64),
an 8-port switch, a 5-port switch, a wireless router, and a public ISP. I currently host a
few services publicly and all communications are protected with PKI certificates.
